# Simulation_mosquitos-dataset
Implement a data simulation by using resampling: 
I will Use this dataset ( _mosquitos_data.csv_) to write Python code to:

    - Create side-by-side boxplots for the number of mosquitos in each group ( _beer vs water) 
    - Reveal any association between beer consumption and attractiveness to mosquitos.
    - Calculate basic statistics measures for each group: Mean, median, standard deviation and explain the numbers.
    - Implement the data simulation and calculate the probability of obtaining the experiment outcome assuming no associatio between beer consumption.
